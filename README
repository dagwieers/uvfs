2. Change to the extracted directory.

    cd uvfs_2.0.3

Install
-------

The TeamSite installer will ask for the location of the compiled uvfs
module and copy the necessary files into the TeamSite installation.

To manually install the uvfs module for use with TeamSite, copy 'pmfs.ko'
and 'uvfs_signal' to the <iw-home>/kernel directory.
