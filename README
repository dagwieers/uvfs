Build
-----

To insure compatibility, the UVFS module should be compiled on the system
on which it will be used.

1. Extract the UVFS source code:

    tar -xvzf uvfs_2.0.8.tar.gz

2. Change to the extracted directory:

    cd uvfs_2.0.8

3. Run 'gmake' without any arguments:

    gmake


Install
-------

The TeamSite installer will ask for the location of the compiled UVFS
module and copy the necessary files into the TeamSite installation.

To manually install the UVFS module for use with TeamSite, copy 'pmfs.ko'
and 'uvfs_signal' to the <iw-home>/kernel directory.


History
-------

The original UVFS module was written by Britt Park and is available
from www.sciencething.org.
